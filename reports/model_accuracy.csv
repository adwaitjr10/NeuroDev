"Claude 3 Haiku","anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0",1,"Sure, here's an example of a Node.js Express API with a `/health` endpoint:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Health check endpoint
app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({ status: 'OK' });
});

// Start the server
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});
```

In this example, we first import the `express` module and create an Express application using `express()`. We then define a `/health` endpoint using the `app.get()` method, which responds with a JSON object containing the status `'OK'` and a 200 status code.

Finally, we start the server using the `app.listen()` method, which listens for incoming requests on the specified port (in this case, `3000`).

To test the `/health` endpoint, you can use a tool like cURL or Postman to send a GET request to `http://localhost:3000/health`. You should receive a response like this:

```json
{
  ""status"": ""OK""
}
```

This `/health` endpoint is commonly used for health checks, which are used to monitor the status of a service or application. It can be integrated with load balancers, monitoring tools, or other systems to ensure that the application is running and responding as expected."
"Claude 3 Sonnet","anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0",1,"Sure, here's a basic Node.js Express API with a `/health` endpoint:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Health check endpoint
app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'OK' });
});

// Start the server
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});
```

Here's what the code does:

1. First, we import the `express` module and create an instance of the Express application.
2. We define the port number (`3000` in this case) where the server will listen for incoming requests.
3. We define a route handler for the `/health` endpoint using the `app.get()` method. This route handler simply sends a JSON response with a `200` status code and a message `'OK'`.
4. Finally, we start the server using the `app.listen()` method, passing in the port number and a callback function that logs a message to the console when the server starts.

To run this code, you'll need to have Node.js and the Express module installed. You can install Express by running the following command:

```
npm install express
```

Once you have Express installed, save the code above in a file (e.g., `app.js`), navigate to the directory containing the file in your terminal, and run the following command:

```
node app.js
```

This will start the server, and you should see the message `Server is running on port 3000` in your terminal.

You can then test the `/health` endpoint by sending a GET request to `http://localhost:3000/health` using a tool like cURL, Postman, or your web browser. You should receive a JSON response with the message `'OK'`.

```
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

This is a very basic example, but you can extend it by adding more routes and functionality as needed for your API."
