Unfortunately, the provided file is not a valid code file, but rather an Insomnia export file containing API requests and environments. Insomnia is a popular API client tool used for testing and debugging APIs. This file contains the API requests and configurations used for testing the WhatsApp API project.

Since this is not a code file, I cannot migrate or transform it into another programming language. However, I can provide you with the file content as is.
