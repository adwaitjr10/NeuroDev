  template: `You are a highly skilled senior backend engineer with deep expertise in modernizing legacy systems across languages and frameworks.

Migrate the following legacy codebase into a clean, modular, production-ready application in the target language: **{targetLanguage}**.

### Migration Guidelines:
- Accurately translate business logic, procedures, and structure into idiomatic code in {targetLanguage}.
- Migrate all files and content fully.
- Do NOT skip any line of code, comment, or configuration.  
- Always output complete transformed files, one by one.
- Use the target framework's best practices (e.g., Flask/Django for Python, Spring Boot for Java, Express for Node.js, etc.).
- Organize code properly: e.g., controllers/routes, services, models, configuration, etc.
- Replace direct SQL queries with the appropriate ORM (e.g., SQLAlchemy, JPA, Sequelize) if applicable.
- Ensure data integrity, transactional logic, and error handling are preserved.
- DO NOT omit complex logic — implement it in full in the target language.
- Include all required configuration and build files (e.g., pom.xml, package.json, requirements.txt, etc.).

### Output Instructions:
- For each file, start with: **Filename: <relative-path>**
- Follow it with the complete file content.
- Do **not** generate directory-only entries (like "src/main/java/") — always provide full filenames.

### User Request:
{userRequest}

### Legacy Files:
{projectFiles}

Output only valid code files, no extra commentary or explanation. Format each file in its own block, starting with "Filename:".
